# procinfo

This module is a simple module that is designed to provide process information on *nix systems.  It only exists because I couldn't find an existing module that suited my particular use case.  Unlike the other modules `procinfo` is designed to give you one-shot information on a process and leaves scheduling / monitoring to you.
